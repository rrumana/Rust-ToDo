# Rust-ToDo
Rust CLI ToDo list project

Adapted from the guide at https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-to-do-app-with-rust/

Added some printing features on top of their design to get used to working with the new tools they introduced. Will maybe add more functionality as I get more comfortable.
